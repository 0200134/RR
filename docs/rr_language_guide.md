RR Language Guide — “From Zero to Hello, Industry!”


# RR Language Guide
> Learn RR from first principles — the industrial language that endures.

## 🧭 Overview
**RR** is a next-generation programming language designed for industrial and embedded systems.  
It focuses on **deterministic safety**, **reproducible builds**, and **long-term compiler stability** —  
where Rust cannot easily guarantee consistency over decades.

RR syntax feels familiar to Rust developers, but its behavior is simpler, frozen, and predictable.

## ⚙️ Hello, Industry!
```rr
fn main() {
    let msg: text = "Hello, Industry!";
    print(msg);
}



Compile & Run


rrc main.rr -o main.bin
./main.bin



Output:


Hello, Industry!




🔧 Variables


let x: int = 10;
mut y: int = 5;
y = y + x;





Keyword
Meaning




let
Immutable binding (default)


mut
Mutable binding, safe within local region




RR enforces deterministic mutability —

no runtime borrow tracking, no data races.



🧩 Regions


RR’s most powerful feature: region-based memory.


region io {
    let buffer: [byte; 128];
    write_device(buffer);
}





Each region defines a compile-time memory lifetime.


No GC, no runtime deallocation, no leaks.


The compiler verifies that no pointer escapes its region.





🔄 Control Flow


if temp > 100 {
    print("Overheat!");
} else {
    print("Normal");
}

while count < 10 {
    count += 1;
}



RR guarantees deterministic control flow without implicit conversions.



🧠 Functions


fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
}



Functions are pure by default.

Side effects must be declared with io or unsafe.



🧱 Structs & Enums


struct Point {
    x: int,
    y: int,
}

enum Mode {
    Auto,
    Manual,
}



Immutable by default; mut keyword allows controlled mutation.



🧩 Modules


module math {
    pub fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int { return a + b; }
}

use math::add;

fn main() {
    let r = add(2, 3);
    print(r);
}



No macros, no implicit imports — everything explicit for transparency.



🔒 Error Handling


fn divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result<int, text> {
    if b == 0 { return Err("Division by zero"); }
    return Ok(a / b);
}



Errors are handled deterministically with tagged unions (Result, Option).



⚡ Compile-Time Execution


constexpr fn square(x: int) -> int { return x * x; }
const VALUE: int = square(5);



No runtime cost — everything resolved during compilation.



🧬 Concurrency


RR uses compile-time verified threads (no data races, no runtime scheduling).


fn worker(id: int) {
    print("Worker:", id);
}

fn main() {
    let t1 = spawn worker(1);
    let t2 = spawn worker(2);
    join(t1);
    join(t2);
}




🚀 Summary


RR provides:




Predictable safety without runtime checks


Region-based deterministic memory


Compiler that never breaks backward compatibility


Syntax similar to Rust, but behavior frozen for decades






“Rust protects you from mistakes.

RR prevents them by design.”
