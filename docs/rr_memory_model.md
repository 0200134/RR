RR Memory Model — Deterministic Region Ownership


# RR Memory Model
> Deterministic Region Ownership for Industrial Systems  
> Version 1.0 — R3C Foundation

---

## 🧭 Overview
RR replaces dynamic borrow checking and garbage collection  
with a **compile-time deterministic region model**.  

Every variable, pointer, and reference in RR belongs to a **region**.  
A region defines the exact *lifetime, allocation, and destruction scope* of data — all resolved **at compile time**.

## ⚙️ Goals of the Memory Model
| Goal | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Predictability** | Memory lifetimes are known before build time. |
| **Zero GC** | No garbage collector or runtime tracking. |
| **Isolation** | Each region owns its memory; no cross-region leaks. |
| **Determinism** | Identical source = identical allocation behavior. |

## 🧩 Region Basics

A `region` is a compile-time verified memory scope:

```rr
region control {
    let buffer: [byte; 512];
    driver_write(buffer);
}





buffer exists only within control region.


When control ends, all allocations are released deterministically.


The compiler enforces that no references escape this scope.





🧱 Example: Nested Regions


region system {
    let config: Config;

    region io {
        let buf: [byte; 256];
        transmit(config, buf);
    } // io region freed here
} // system region freed here



Nested regions are allowed.

The compiler validates that inner regions never outlive their parents.



🔒 Ownership Rules




Each variable belongs to exactly one region.


Moving data between regions transfers ownership.


References are immutable by default.


A pointer cannot escape its owning region.


Region-free code (global state) is discouraged and restricted.




Example — invalid pointer escape:


fn leak_pointer() -> ptr<int> {
    region temp {
        let x: int = 42;
        return &x; // ❌ error: pointer escape
    }
}



Compile-time error:


E201: pointer escape from region [temp] to [global]




🧬 Region Lifetime Model




Step
Action
Lifetime




1
Region declared
Allocation scope begins


2
Variables created
Memory owned by region


3
Region closes
Compiler inserts auto-destruction


4
Exit verified
No dangling pointers permitted




Compiler enforces:


∀region R: exit(R) ⇒ ∄ref(x) ∧ owner(ref(x)) = R




🧠 Region Graph Visualization


[global]
 ├── region system
 │    ├── config: Config
 │    └── region io
 │         └── buf: [byte;256]
 └── region debug
      └── log_buffer: [byte;128]



Each edge is a compile-time verified lifetime dependency.

No runtime heap traversal is required.

🧩 Mutable Regions


You can declare mutable memory safely:


region counter {
    mut count: int = 0;
    while count < 5 {
        count += 1;
    }
}



All mutations are local to the region.

No data races or concurrent mutation hazards exist.



🔗 Shared (Const) Regions


RR supports read-only shared regions:


const region settings {
    let version: text = "1.0.0";
    let baudrate: int = 9600;
}





Immutable across all threads.


Verified at compile time for static safety.





💾 Pointers and References


region task {
    let port: ptr<Device>;
    port.write(0xFF);
}



All pointers are region-bound:


ptr<region_name, Type>



If a pointer tries to cross regions → compile-time error.



🧰 Compile-Time Validation Process




Build Region Graph


Verify Ownership Flow


Detect Potential Escapes


Validate Lifetime Closure


Emit Allocation Map




Example of compiler report:


[R3C-RR Compiler] Region Summary:
- region control : 3 allocations, 512 bytes
- region io       : 1 allocation, 128 bytes
- No leaks detected ✅




🧮 Deterministic Allocation Map

io

🧠 Embedded Compatibility


RR’s region system was designed to operate without OS dependencies.

Each region can be statically allocated in .bss or .data sections,

making RR ideal for microcontrollers, robotics, and aerospace.



✅ Summary




No GC, no runtime allocation, no leaks


All lifetimes resolved at compile time


Memory ownership deterministic and verifiable


Ideal for embedded and safety-critical systems






“Rust checks your borrows at runtime.

RR proves your ownership before you build.”
