RR Type System Specification — Static, Deterministic, and Region-Aware


# RR Type System Specification
> Static, Deterministic, and Region-Aware  
> Version 1.0 — R3C Foundation Industrial Language Division

---

## 🧭 Overview

RR uses a **strictly static type system** —  
no runtime typing, no implicit conversions, and no hidden coercions.  

All types are known, checked, and fixed at **compile time**.  
The compiler enforces region-based ownership and deterministic type resolution,  
allowing RR to operate without borrow checkers or garbage collectors.

## ⚙️ Core Type Goals

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Static Safety** | Every variable’s type is known and verified before build. |
| **No Implicit Conversion** | Type conversions must be explicit. |
| **Region Awareness** | Each type knows its lifetime region. |
| **Determinism** | Type inference produces identical results across platforms. |

---

## 🧩 Primitive Types

| Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `int` | 64-bit | Signed integer |
| `uint` | 64-bit | Unsigned integer |
| `float` | 64-bit | IEEE floating-point |
| `bool` | 1 byte | Boolean flag |
| `text` | variable | UTF-8 immutable string |
| `byte` | 8-bit | Raw memory byte |

Examples:
```rr
let a: int = 10;
let b: bool = true;
let s: text = "Hello";




🧱 Composite Types


Structs


struct Point {
    x: int,
    y: int,
}





Immutable by default


Can be declared mut inside a region for local mutation




Enums


enum Mode {
    Auto,
    Manual,
    Error,
}





Tagged unions with static variant layout


Deterministic integer representation





🧩 Arrays and Slices


let arr: [int; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];





Fixed length at compile time


Region-bound (no dynamic resizing)


Slices allowed only within same region:




let part: &[int] = arr[0..2];




🔒 Type Inference


RR supports compile-time deterministic type inference.


let x = 10;         // int
let y = 1.0;        // float
let name = "RR";    // text



Inference is purely syntactic:




Identical inputs always yield identical inferred types.


No cross-module inference propagation.





⚙️ Const and Constexpr Types


Compile-time evaluation uses constexpr and const:


constexpr fn pow2(x: int) -> int {
    return x * x;
}

const VALUE: int = pow2(8);



Everything resolved before codegen — no runtime math.



🧩 Generic and Parametric Types (Phase 2 Plan)


Future support for deterministic generics:


fn max<T: Comparable>(a: T, b: T) -> T {
    if a > b { return a; }
    return b;
}





Type constraints checked at compile time.


No monomorphization duplication — identical types yield identical binaries.


Planned for RR v1.2+ toolchain.





🧠 Region-Aware Type Model


Each type carries an invisible “region tag” that ties it to a memory lifetime.


ptr<region io, Device>
arr<region control, byte>



Example


region control {
    let port: ptr<Device>;
    port.write(0xFF);
}



If port escapes its region, compiler throws:


E204: pointer escape from [control] region




🧩 Result and Option Types


RR uses tagged results for deterministic error handling:


fn divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result<int, text> {
    if b == 0 { return Err("divide by zero"); }
    return Ok(a / b);
}



Result<T, E> and Option<T> are built-in core templates.



🔗 Type Immutability Rules




Context
Default
Mutability Scope




Local variable
Immutable
mut keyword


Struct fields
Immutable
Declared mut explicitly


Function parameters
Pass-by-value (immutable)
Use mut param for local copies


Region variables
Immutable unless declared mut






🧬 Deterministic Type Behavior


Same Source → Same Type Map


The compiler emits a reproducible type map for every build.


Example:


[TYPE MAP]
- x: int
- y: float
- msg: text
- result: Result<int, text>



Type map hash is part of the build signature.



⚡ Comparison with Rust




Concept
Rust
RR




Ownership
Borrow checker (runtime validated)
Region ownership (compile-time)


Mutability
Per-reference
Per-region


Lifetime
Annotated manually
Auto-inferred per region


Type inference
Contextual
Deterministic & isolated


Null safety
Option
Option (same)


Const evaluation
Limited
Fully constexpr


Generics
Trait-bound
Deterministic templates





✅ Summary


RR’s type system is frozen, deterministic, and machine-verifiable.

No implicit coercion, no dangling references, and no runtime surprises.




“In Rust, types protect you from mistakes.

In RR, types prevent them from ever existing.”
